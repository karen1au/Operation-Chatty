Operation Chatty
=====================
> 🕵️: .-- . .-.. -.-. --- -- .

A real-time chatroom buildt with ReactJS and WebSocket ~~(for agents)~~.

## What does it do?
!["monitor number of user"](https://github.com/karen1au/chatty-app/blob/master/doc/online-user.gif?raw=true)

Not only you can chat with other users, you can also monitor the number of users that are currently online.
Each user is assigned a different colour.

!["change username"](https://github.com/karen1au/chatty-app/blob/master/doc/change-name.gif?raw=true)

Feel free to change your username (as an agent we don't stick with only one name!) while keeping your colour.
To keep up our professionalism, no matter what your name is, we add the prefix Agent to everyone.

!["add image"](https://github.com/karen1au/chatty-app/blob/master/doc/add-image.gif?raw=true)

Sometimes words are cheap...we need _images_ ! Insert any url ends with .png/.gif/.jpg to get your image showing.
